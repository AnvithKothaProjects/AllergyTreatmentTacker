# AllergyTreatmentTacker
This app is made with react native in expo. The google cloud vision api is used for text recognition in the image.
This app is made to coordinate with an organization called the SoCal Food Allergy Institute, which aims to treat food allergies through immunization therapy, which 
is giving a patient the foods they're allergic to in small quantities and slowly ramping up.
It allows users to submit an image of their treatment plans. It converts this to a digital plan, giving notifications and helping users keep track of their progress
To run it, change the directiory to my-app, type "npx expo start", and scan the qr code.
